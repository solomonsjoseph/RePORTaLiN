Introduction
============

Overview
--------

RePORTaLiN is a beta-stage data processing pipeline designed to extract and transform 
medical research data from Excel files into structured JSONL format. The system is built 
with robustness, efficiency, and ease of use in mind.

Purpose
-------

The RePORTaLiN pipeline addresses the common challenge of converting complex Excel-based 
research data into a structured, machine-readable format. It's specifically designed for:

- Medical research data management
- Clinical trial data processing
- Data standardization and validation
- Research data archiving

Key Benefits
------------

**Speed and Efficiency**
   The pipeline can process 43 Excel files in approximately 15-20 seconds, making it 
   suitable for large-scale data processing tasks.

**Intelligent Processing**
   - Automatic table detection within Excel sheets
   - Smart handling of empty rows and columns
   - Automatic data type inference and conversion
   - Duplicate column name resolution

**Robustness**
   - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
   - Detailed logging for debugging and auditing
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Graceful handling of edge cases

**Flexibility**
   - Dynamic dataset detection (works with any dataset folder)
   - Configurable paths and settings
   - Modular architecture for easy customization
   - Command-line options for partial execution

Use Cases
---------

RePORTaLiN is ideal for:

1. **Data Migration**: Converting legacy Excel data to modern formats
2. **Data Integration**: Standardizing data from multiple sources
3. **Quality Assurance**: Validating and cleaning research data
4. **Archival**: Creating structured backups of Excel-based data
5. **Analysis Pipeline**: Preparing data for downstream analysis tools

System Requirements
-------------------

- **Python**: 3.13 or higher
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Memory**: Minimal (handles large Excel files efficiently)
- **Storage**: Depends on dataset size (outputs are typically smaller than inputs)

Design Philosophy
-----------------

RePORTaLiN follows these core principles:

**Simplicity**
   One command to run the entire pipeline: ``python main.py``

**Transparency**
   Comprehensive logging shows exactly what's happening at each step

**Reliability**
   Extensive error handling ensures the pipeline fails gracefully

**Maintainability**
   Clean, well-documented code makes it easy to understand and modify
